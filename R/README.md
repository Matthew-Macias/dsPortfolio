# R

R was the first coding language that I learnt upon pursing a career in Data Science. As such I am extremely confident in applying it to Data Science problems. 

## R_swimminginvestigation

Having been inspired by the performances of the Australian Swimming Team at the Tokyo Olympics, I wanted to investigate what makes an athlete so successful compared to their peers in the pool. The investigation looked at both physical attributes such as height, age etc as well as business aspects such as investment into pathways. This investigation uses packages such as dpylr, ggplot as well as implements base r functions such as k-means clustering and PCA.

## R_netball

This projects highlights my ability to work with extremely messy data. The original data source has 100+ columns, with significant proportions of missing values and duplicate records. The end result is a clean dataset that is imported into Power BI to create a longitudinal injury report for the Australian Diamonds Netball team.
