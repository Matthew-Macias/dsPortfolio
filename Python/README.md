# Python

Python is a partcularly strong skill of mine. This project folder showcases some of my personal projects that use Python as a means to process and explore data.

## Python_garmin

Showcases packages such as pandas, numpy, gpxpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly express and folium. It is an exploration of my own persional garmin data and has similarities to how I would explore business datasets upon being initially being exposed to them.
