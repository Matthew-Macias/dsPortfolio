# Data Science Portfolio

Hi! I'm Matthew.

I'm a Data Scientist currently working at NSW Health. I have an undergraduates degree in Health Science as well as a Masters in Data Science. I love all things data, particularly when they intersect with the health industry. This repository serves as a showcase of my skills that I can apply to roles within the data science industry. 

## Contents
- Python:
  - Python_garmin: EDA on my personal garmin data (activity and gpx data), using pandas matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, folium
  - Python_opencv: Using opencv template matching to identify wally within a wheres wally image

## Current Project
- Computer Vision in Team Sports:
  - Inspired by Tesla's Full Self Driving, I am Working on implementing CNN's and transformers to transform 2D video input of team sports to a 3D vector space for      the purposes of identifying patterns in player movement which potentially lead to important events such as scoring.
