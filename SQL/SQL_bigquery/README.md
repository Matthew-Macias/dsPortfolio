# SQL_bigquery

This project uses Google BigQuery to access the San Francisco Bike Dataset. Once I have accessed the data using SQL queries, I use pandas and matplotlib to complete some intial data exploration. This process mimics a business scenario in which I would extract the data and complete the initial exploration process.
